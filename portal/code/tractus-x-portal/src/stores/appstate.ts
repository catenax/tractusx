  description: `<b>Seamless part traceability through the n-tier supply chain.</b><br />

  PartChain is an open-source software tool that allows you to track components in the n-tier supply chain. In addition to the unique relationship knowledge you get detailed information about the components of your direct suppliers as well as your direct customers. This lets you answer questions such as:<br />
  <br/>
  <li>What’s the exact lead time between the production of a subcomponent and your own components?</li>
  <li>To where in the world are my components distributed and where are my suppliers located?</li>
  <li>What’s the exact composition of my component on a unique ID level?</li>
  <br />Because all of that is important information, PartChain keeps a strong one-up one-down visibility rule. You and the other parties in the network always only see their direct suppliers and customers data as well as their own data. Your competitors won’t be able to get any sensitive information about your production data.<br />

  <br/><b>Recall management made easy</b><br />
  Because you and all other partners in the network now know the exact composition of the components that are produced, recall management is much simpler than before. No more tedious and messy emails, excel sheets and database dumps in case of a quality issue. You simply select the components that you need to recall, choose a quality alert criticality and distribute the information in the network. Of course, only your direct customers will be notified. In case you receive a quality alert, you can see at one glimpse, which of your parts could be affected by defective supplier parts and also immediately warn your own customers. All with one click.<br />

  <br/><b>Unlock the potential for dozens of new use cases</b><br />
  Recall management of course isn’t the only use case for PartChain. As soon as you have enough relationship about your supply chain, you can drastically simplify i.e.<br />
  <br/>
  <li>CO2 Emission handling</li>
  <li>Circular Economy</li>
  <li>Analysis of Quality Documents</li>
  <li>Customs processes</li>
  <li>Demand and Capacity Management</li>
  <li>and many more</li>
