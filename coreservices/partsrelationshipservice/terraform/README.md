# Terraform code

Terraform scripts to deploy the PRS infrastructure on Microsoft Azure.

As you can see in `version.tf`, the terraform state is persisted in a storage account. The storage account and the container have been created manually.

## Prerequisites

The following tools need to be installed on your system where you run the scripts:
- [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)
- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

## Quick start

Run the following commands to deploy the PoC infrastructure:

1. Sign-on to Azure and select the target subscription for the PoC landscape with `az login --tenant <catenax-tenant>`
1. Check whether the variables for your target environment have been correctly set `cat variables.tf`
1. From the main directory of this repository, run `terraform init`
1. Run `terraform plan`
1. Run `terraform apply`
